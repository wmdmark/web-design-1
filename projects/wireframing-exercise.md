The purpose of this exercise is to help you better plan for and map out a user interface (UI) for a website or app before thinking about or commiting to a visual style.


First a few terms:
- Wireframe: Think of wireframes a blueprint for a building, they're about structure, accessability and logistics, not visual style. 
- User story: A "user story" is a way of describing the primary tasks a user should be able to complete with your app/website.

For this project, you'll be wireframing a mobile app interface for students to order a pick-up lunch from the dining common.
Here are the user stories for what the user should be able to do:

- A user should be able to select one of three lunch options (e.g. combo meals)
- A user should be able submit their lunch order with their BJU login
- A user should see a confirmation screen that sumarizes their order and gives an estimated time for pickup.

Your wireframes should meet the following requirements:
- Should be sized for mobile (see example wireframes)
- Should use actual text/copy, no lorem ipsum
- All screens should be in the same file

This project will be done quickly, so keep your work focused on cleary demonstrating the above user actions, not on layout/style.

User the example wireframes/documents are in this Dropbox folder here: 

When you've finished your project, upload an image of your wireframe to the discussion area below.
