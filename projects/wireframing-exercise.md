The purpose of this exercise is to help you better plan for and map out a user interface (UI) for a website or app before thinking about or committing to a visual style.


## First a few terms:

- __Wireframe__: Think of wireframes a blueprint for a building, they're about structure, accessibility and logistics, not visual style. 
- __User story__: A "user story" is a way of describing the primary tasks a user should be able to complete with your app/website.

## The Challenge
For this project, you'll be wireframing a mobile app interface for students to order a pick-up lunch from the dining common.

Here are the user stories for what the user should be able to do:

- A user should be able to select one of three lunch options (e.g. combo meals)
- A user should be able submit their lunch order with their BJU login
- A user should see a confirmation screen that summarizes their order and gives an estimated time for pickup.

Your wireframes should meet the following requirements:

- Should be sized for mobile (see example wireframes)
- Should use actual text/copy, no lorem ipsum
- All screens should be in the same file

This project will be done quickly, so keep your work focused on clearly demonstrating the above user actions, not on layout/style.

__Project submission__: Save your work under the [In-class Challenge Wireframes](https://webdesign.mybalsamiq.com/projects/in-classchallengewireframes/grid) project in MyBalsamiq. You can [clone the starter template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5xcxa0aolwnemgb/Screenshot%202014-11-10%2017.14.12.png?dl=0) for your project. Be sure to include your name in the project title or on the wireframes when you save your work.
