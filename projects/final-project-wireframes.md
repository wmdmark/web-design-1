**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to plan out your final website before committing to visual design and code. This is an important step in making sure your final project accomplishes your goals.

**Step 1: Write goals/user stories**

*Example goal:*
The goal of my personal website is to demonstrate my design abilities and encourage people to hire me.

*Example user stories*
- A user should be able to easily understand my abilities and see my work
- A user should be able to share my work with others
- A user should be able to contact me about potential work

**Step 2: Wireframe the UI**

Create a wireframe of the UI needed to accomplish your goals and user stories

Your wireframes should...

- Include all the screens necessary for a user to complete your top user stories
- Should use clear, concise and grammatically correct copy (no lorem ipsum)
- Should be mocked up at actual size in pixels

Your wireframes should _not_ include:

- Colors
- Typography (other than the generic sans-serif)
- Image or textures

I would recommend wireframing your site for mobile screen sizes first.
