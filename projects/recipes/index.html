    <h1>Chocolate Peanut Butter Cupcakes</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <em>For the filling:  </em>
    <ul>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
      1 cup confectioners' sugar
      ¾ cup creamy peanut butter
      4 tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature
      ½ tsp. vanilla extract

For the cake:
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. salt
1 cup sour cream 
2 tbsp. milk
1 tsp. vanilla extract
8 tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature
1½ cups sugar
2 large eggs

For the frosting:
8 oz. cream cheese, at room temperature
4 tbsp. unsalted butter, softened
½ cup creamy peanut butter
3¼ cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350° F.  Line two cupcake pans with paper liners.  

To make the filling, combine the confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, butter and vanilla extract in a bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined.  Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls (at least 24) and set aside on a baking sheet.

To make the cake batter, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; whisk together and set aside.  In a liquid measuring cup, stir together the sour cream, milk and vanilla extract.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar, and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed.  With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the dry ingredients and the sour cream mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.  Mix just until incorporated. 

Spoon a tablespoon or two of batter into the bottom of each cupcake liner.  Place a ball of the peanut butter filling in each cupcake well and top with the remaining batter so that all the cups are filled.  Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Allow to cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

To make the frosting, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, butter and peanut butter until smooth.  Slowly mix in the confectioners' sugar, beating until smooth and well blended.  Mix in the whipped topping until smooth and fluffy.  Frost cooled cupcakes as desired.

Capellini With Fresh Ricotta

INGREDIENTS (serves 3-4)
8 ounces capellini or angel hair pasta
26 ounces (about 2 cups) tomato sauce (jarred or made Basic Tomato Sauce)
1/4 cup good quality olive oil, plus more for thinning the ricotta and drizzling
1 cup fresh ricotta (preferably homemade)
Chopped parsley and grated Parmesan for garnishing
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
PROCEDURES
1
Bring a large pot of salty water to boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. It will happen quickly with a thin pasta like capellini.
2
In the meantime, combine the tomato sauce and olive oil in a saucepan to warm. In a bowl, mix the ricotta with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and enough olive oil to loosen it up. Spoon the warm tomato sauce into bowls.
3
Use tongs to lift the pasta straight from the pot and into the waiting bowls. Twist it into high mounds, then top with the ricotta mixture and drizzle with olive oil. Top with fresh pepper, parsley, and Parmesan as desired

1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/8 teaspoon xantham gum (optional - a natural thickener)
1/2 cup chopped pecans
4 whole pecan halves
sweetened whipped cream for garnish

directions:
Preheat oven to 350º (I used the toaster oven). Crush the graham crackers or gingersnaps to create crumbs. Add melted butter, stir well to combined. Spread on baking sheet. Toast in the oven 3 – 5 minutes until crumbs start to brown. Cool.

Process the cream cheese, sugars, cream and vanilla in a food processor until smooth. Add the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cardamom, and xantham gum. Process until smooth.

Spoon a half of the graham cracker crumbs into four 1/2 cup-capacity dishes, layer on a few chopped pecans. Divide half of the cheesecake mixture evenly between the dishes and top with the remaining graham cracker or gingersnap crumbs and then more pecans. Divide the remaining cheesecake mixture between the dishes.

Garnish with whipped cream and pecans. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm. Serves 4.

Pub Burger Extraordinaire

Ingredients

Makes: 6 burgers
4 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, freshly shredded (not prepackaged)
3/4 cup Parmigiano Reggiano, grated
1/3 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup walnuts
2 cloves garlic. smashed and peeled
2 pounds fresh ground round steak - 85-percent lean
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 egg, beaten
1 scallion, minced
2/3 cup plain bread crumbs
2 tablespoons oil
6 Kaiser rolls, split
6 slices meaty large beefsteak tomato

Preparation method
Prep: 35 mins  | Cook: 10 mins | Extra time: 5 mins, other
1. Preheat grill to Medium High.
2. To make the filling, combine the shredded cheese, 1/2 cup Parmigiano, 1/4 cup mustard, walnuts, and garlic cloves in a food processor. Pulse to combine. Place in a small bowl for later.
3. Place the ground meat in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add beaten egg, scallion and the remaining tablespoon of mustard.
4. In a small bowl combine the breadcrumbs and Parmigiano. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on top of the meat. Gently mix all ingredients until combined but do not over work the mixture. Turn out onto a plate and evenly divide into 6 sections. Make a 4 inch burger (I use a burger press for continuity of size, shape, and grilling time).
5. Place a ball (a large gumball size, about 1 1/2 tablespoons) of the cheese filling in the middle of the burger. Depress slightly but do not go beyond a 2 inch diameter.
6. Cover the cheese with the meat mixture and finish hand molding the burger. Repeat for each burger. This makes 6 burgers. Set aside the rest of the cheese for the topping.
7. Brush the grill rack with oil. Place the patties on the rack and grill until browned on the bottoms, 3-4 minutes. Turn the patties on the rack and continue grilling until done to preference, about 4-5 minutes longer for medium.
8. During the last few minutes of grilling, brush the cut side of the rolls with the softened butter and place this side down along the outer edges of the rack to toast lightly 1-2 minutes.
9. To assemble the burgers, place a burger on the bottom of each roll. Place a tablespoon of the reserved cheese filling on top of the hot burger. Place a slice of tomato on top and cover with the roll top. Pass them around and eat!
Alternate method
Extra mustard may be passed around but is really not necessary. Have a napkin handy!
