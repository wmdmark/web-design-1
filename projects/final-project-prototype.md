**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive prototype of your final project using HTML & CSS. This will also serve as the baseline for your final code that will go online at the end of this project.


**Getting setup**

- Create a good folder structure for your project. You should have a folder for images and a folder for your CSS.
- Create an index.html file in the root of your project folder. Here's a basic HTML structure to get you started:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/wmdmark/6f2f98dc30ba35a902db.js"></script>

- Download [normalize.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/necolas/normalize.css/master/normalize.css) into your css folder and create a <link> tag to include it in your index.html file
- Create a `styles.css` file in your css folder and make sure that's linked in as well

**Prototyping**

- Use HTML/CSS to implement the primary layout of your landing page from your wireframes.
- It may be helpful to review your grid project and the tutorial that went along with it.
- If your project uses more than one type of layout on different pages, prototype at least one of the other layouts as well in a different HTML file
- Make sure your prototype is responsive and works well at both mobile and desktop sizes.

_Note: Since this is only a prototype, don't worry too much about findal design elements (images, colors etc..)_
