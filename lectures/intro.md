# With the internet you can...

1. Learn anything
2. Communicate with *anyone* at a distance
3. Outsource your brain

# Learn anything

1. Accessible: All of the worlds knowledge in your pocket. 
2. Connected: Hyperlinked references.
3. Rich: Videos, audio, interactive elements, etc.

^ 1. Don't have to go anywhere. Arguments/debates aren't as fun anymore.
^ 2. Interactive, linked, include media. We'll be using highly interactive code-learing in this class. Bye bye textbooks

# Communicate with anyone

- Old ways to communicate
  - Letters, voice, face-to-face etc..
- New ways to communicate
  - Texting/chatting
  - Tweeting/status updates
  - Image based communication :sleepy:

# Outsource your brain

- Most of education is about memorizing facts.
- Is there a reason to memorize information anymore?
- What is really valuable to learn?
